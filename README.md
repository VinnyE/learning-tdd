# Learning TDD
Just a small app made while following a series of blog articles on TDD over at: <http://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-javascript-tdd-intro/> 

What was covered:
* Stubbing network calls.
* Asynchronous tests and Promises.
* Making tests work without a browser by using Cheerio.
